    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These basic muffins can be made as-is, or you can add one of several different ingredients for a variety of muffins. All options are delicious!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup fresh bluberries</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners.</li>
        <li>Stir flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar together in a large bowl; make a well in the center.</li>
        <li>Beat egg with a fork in a small bowl or 2-cup measuring cup; whisk in milk and oil. Pour egg mixture all at once into flour mixture; mix quickly and lightly with a fork until just moistened. The batter will be lumpy. (Fold in additional ingredients if using; see variations below). Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 25 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
